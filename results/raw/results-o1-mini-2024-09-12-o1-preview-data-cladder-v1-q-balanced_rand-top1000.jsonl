This means that any observed association between smoking and lung cancer could be partly or wholly due to the underlying effect of gender.\n\n3. **Method 1 (Stratification by Gender):**\n   - By examining the correlation between smoking and lung cancer within each gender separately, Method 1 effectively controls for the confounding effect of gender. This allows for a clearer assessment of the direct relationship between smoking and lung cancer without the bias introduced by gender.\n\n4. **Method 2 (Overall Correlation):**\n   - Looking at the overall correlation without accounting for gender means that the observed association may be confounded. The effect attributed to smoking on lung cancer could be partially due to gender differences in both smoking behavior and lung cancer risk.\n\n5. **Gender is Unobserved:**\n   - Even though gender is unobserved, Method 1 conceptually represents the correct approach to control for confounding.
